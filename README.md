# Math-Model

This is a legacy project as part of a research experience with Soren Dunn. The project we ended up working more on is a forked repo of AI@UIUC's new paper, Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)! This forked repo, where we expand capabilities to solving mathematical problems, can be found in my profile.
